- exfiltration: supported=False weakly_supported=False confidence=0.0 first_seen=None evidence=No direct exfiltration indicator was isolated in this file.
- payload_deployment: supported=False weakly_supported=True confidence=0.35 first_seen=2026-01-02T20:11:16.309044+00:00 evidence=Internal RDP fan-out suggests operator-driven payload staging, but no stronger correlated payload-drop indicator was isolated.
Best ingress candidate: external `179.60.146.37` -> internal `10.128.239.57` with confidence `80`.

### Reconnaissance Pivot
No strong external reconnaissance pattern was isolated in this file.

### Initial Access Pivot
External RDP into 10.128.239.57 is the strongest initial-access hypothesis.
- 179.60.146.37 -> 10.128.239.57 packets=96028 app_packets=61691 post_login_targets=24 suspicious=True
- 179.60.146.32 -> 10.128.239.57 packets=91418 app_packets=58719 post_login_targets=24 suspicious=True

- 147.45.112.188 -> 10.128.239.57 packets=48446 app_packets=29492 post_login_targets=24 suspicious=True

### Lateral Movement & Discovery Pivot
The focus host shows rapid internal discovery and lateral movement patterns aligned with the challenge scenario.
- SMB/RPC scan source 10.128.239.57 unique_targets=5 attempts=6 duration=28312.02
- Internal RDP spread source 10.128.239.57 unique_targets=14 sessions=14 duration=18453.42

### Administrative Activity Pivot
Possible account or group administration markers were observed over SMB/DCERPC.
- DCERPC markers 10.128.239.57 -> 10.128.239.23 markers={'c$': 7}

### Exfiltration Pivot
No direct exfiltration indicator was observed in this file.

### Payload Deployment Pivot
Internal RDP fan-out from the focus host is consistent with hands-on-keyboard deployment.
- Internal RDP spread source 10.128.239.57 unique_targets=14 sessions=14 duration=18453.42


### Recommended Filters
- `ip.addr == 10.128.239.57 and tcp.port == 3389`
- `ip.src == 10.128.239.57 and tcp.dstport in {135,445,3389,5985,5986}`
- `ip.addr == 10.128.239.57 and tcp.port == 445`
- `ip.addr == 10.128.239.57 and dcerpc`
- `ip.addr == 179.60.146.37 and ip.addr == 10.128.239.57 and tcp.port == 3389`
- `http.request.method == "POST"`
- `http.host contains "temp.sh" or tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "temp.sh"`

### Notes
- The challenge hypothesis fits an external-to-internal RDP compromise focused on 10.128.239.57.
- The same host that received external RDP also generated broad SMB/RPC discovery, which supports rapid post-login network mapping.
- Internal RDP spread from the focus host is consistent with manual operator-driven lateral movement or payload staging.
- This PCAP does not currently show the challenge's expected exfiltration indicators, so exfil may be elsewhere in the capture set or via another protocol.
- PCAP alone cannot prove whether RDP access came from bought credentials, brute force, or a vulnerable exposed service.
